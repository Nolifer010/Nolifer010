ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nolifer010

In August 2024 I started my way to learn C++.

This journey is an experiment which goal is to show what level I can achieve till the end of the year.

I don't have any technical background. For 6 years I've been studying international relations. And now I work as a procurement manager.
For me coding is more like a hobby, but a hobby that helps me in my everyday life.
